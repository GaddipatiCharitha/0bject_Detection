Car/Object Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV
This project uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV in Python to detect objects (like cars) in images and videos. It loads a pre-trained model, processes the input, and displays results with bounding boxes in real-time.
What It Does:
Reads video or webcam feed

Detects cars in real-time

Draws rectangles around detected cars

Shows the result live

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
Python

OpenCV

Haar Cascade or DNN model
